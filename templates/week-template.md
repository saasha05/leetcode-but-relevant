## 💡 Why It Matters (Senior Lens)

Connect the pattern directly to backend/infra/AI systems: performance, correctness, tradeoffs, ownership.

---

## 🧠 Work Reflection

Prompt(s) that force you to map this concept to:
- A real system you’ve worked on
- A decision you’d critique or redesign now

---

## 🧩 Deliverables

<summary><strong>💡 Problem-Solving Hints</strong></summary>

### Pattern Hints (General)

**Approach:**
- Hint 1: [Vague guidance about the pattern - guides thinking without revealing solution]
- Hint 2: [More specific about when to use it or how it applies]
- Hint 3: [Concrete step or invariant - almost there but not the full solution]

**Edge Cases:**
- [Common edge cases for this pattern]
- [Boundary conditions to consider]
- [Special input scenarios]

**Common Pitfalls:**
- [What to avoid or watch out for]
- [Common mistakes in implementation]
- [Conceptual misunderstandings]

### Problem-Specific Hints

**Problem Name:**
- Hint 1: [Pattern-specific guidance for this problem]
- Hint 2: [More specific to this problem's constraints]
- Hint 3: [Almost there, but not the complete solution]
