# 📚 Phases Overview

> This file links the weeks in the `weeks/` directory into clear learning steps — showing how each phase helps you build practical problem-solving skills.

---

## 🧩 Phase 1 — Arrays, Strings & Hashing (Weeks 1–6)
**Theme:** *Getting comfortable with basic data structures and complexity.*

- Learn to spot hidden O(n²) loops and inefficient data access.
- Move from brute force to smarter, more efficient solutions.
- Focus on arrays, hashmaps, sets, prefix sums, and sliding windows.
- Real examples:
  - API latency and throughput.
  - Caching and idempotency.
  - Detecting duplicates and summarizing data.

📍 **Capstone:** Understanding data layout and lookup patterns in real systems.

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2 — Stacks, Queues & Pointers (Weeks 7–12)
**Theme:** *Understanding control flow and data movement.*

- Build intuition for recursion, call stacks, and queues.
- Practice with stacks, monotonic stacks, BFS/DFS, and two pointers.
- Real examples:
  - Async workflows.
  - Retry and backoff systems.
  - Parsing and input validation.
  - Detecting deadlocks or cycles.

📍 **Capstone:** Combining control flow patterns in practical problems.

---

## 🌲 Phase 3 — Trees & Graphs (Weeks 13–18)
**Theme:** *Modeling relationships and dependencies.*

- Get comfortable with trees and graphs for representing data.
- Focus on traversal, lowest common ancestor, serialization, grids, and DAGs.
- Real examples:
  - Ownership and configuration trees.
  - Dependency management in builds and services.
  - Modeling failure domains.

📍 **Capstone:** Reasoning about dependencies and rollout order.

---

## 🧮 Phase 4 — Dynamic Programming (Weeks 25–30)
**Theme:** *Breaking problems into smaller parts and reusing results.*

- Learn to think in terms of subproblems and caching results.
- Practice recursion, memoization, longest increasing subsequence, knapsack, and path counting.
- Real examples:
  - Query planning.
  - Scheduling resources.
  - Designing experiments.
  - Comparing versions or diffs.

📍 **Capstone:** Applying dynamic programming to optimize real-world problems.

---

## ⚖️ Phase 5 — Binary Search, Heaps & Intervals (Weeks 31–36)
**Theme:** *Making decisions based on thresholds and priorities.*

- Master binary search (classic and parametric), heaps, and interval problems.
- Real examples:
  - Job scheduling.
  - Query tuning.
  - Rate limiting.
  - Planning maintenance windows.

📍 **Capstone:** Simulating load balancing and scheduling scenarios.

---

## 🧠 Phase 6 — Integration & Mock Interviews (Weeks 37–42)
**Theme:** *Putting it all together and practicing communication.*

- Combine all topics into system-level problem solving.
- Focus on mixed problems, mock interviews, and clear explanations.
- Real examples:
  - Explaining design choices.
  - Defending technical decisions.
  - Staying calm and clear under pressure.

📍 **Capstone:** Full interview simulation — algorithms, design, and behavioral.
