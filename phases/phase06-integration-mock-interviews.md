# Phase 6 — Integration & Mock Interviews

**🎯 Purpose**  
Synthesize everything into interview-ready and job-real behavior by pressure-testing whether you can show senior/lead-level thinking end-to-end: solving problems while narrating tradeoffs, doing system design that references concrete DS/Algo instincts, and communicating clearly under interview constraints.

---

## 📋 Phase Overview

This phase is the culmination of the entire curriculum. You'll work through integrating multiple data structures (Week 37), medium-level mock interviews (Week 38), hard-level mock interviews (Week 39), system design fundamentals (Week 40), behavioral and technical communication (Week 41), and a final integration review (Week 42) — but always with an eye toward demonstrating senior/lead-level thinking under interview conditions.

The weeks progress from hybrid pattern integration (Week 37) through progressively challenging mock interviews (Weeks 38-39), system design that connects algorithms to architecture (Week 40), communication frameworks (Week 41), and a final capstone that simulates a full interview panel (Week 42). By the end, you'll be able to solve mid/hard problems while narrating tradeoffs, do a system design that references concrete DS/Algo instincts, and communicate clearly under interview constraints.

The mental model that emerges: **true mastery is integration — showing thought process, communication, and engineering tradeoffs live.**

## 📅 Weeks in This Phase

- [Week 37 — Integrating Data Structures](../weeks/week37-integration-data-structures.md) — Combine arrays, stacks, queues, and maps into coherent workflows
- [Week 38 — Mock Interview I (Medium Level)](../weeks/week38-medium-interview-simulation.md) — Simulate full technical interview combining arrays, maps, and basic recursion
- [Week 39 — Mock Interview II (Hard Level)](../weeks/week39-hard-interview-simulation.md) — Handle advanced recursion, graphs, and DP under interview conditions
- [Week 40 — System Design Fundamentals](../weeks/week40-system-design-fundamentals.md) — Translate algorithmic reasoning into scalable service design
- [Week 41 — Behavioral & Technical Communication](../weeks/week41-behavioral-prep.md) — Develop structured frameworks to communicate reasoning, decisions, and tradeoffs
- [Week 42 — Final Integration & Mock Panel](../weeks/week42-final-integration-review.md) — Simulate full senior interview panel: algorithms + design + behavioral

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Hybrid Patterns** — Mix and reason across structures without confusing their invariants; real engineering rarely fits one pattern
- **Mock Interview Practice** — Timed problem-solving under pressure; maintain readable, working solutions while narrating thought process
- **System Design Integration** — Connect time complexity to infrastructure cost; identify algorithmic patterns that define service behavior
- **Technical Communication** — Articulate how you think, not just what you did; communicate tradeoffs under stress
- **Full Panel Simulation** — Algorithms + design + behavioral; defend technical and architectural reasoning end-to-end

## 🔗 Real-World Connections

Where these patterns show up in production:

- **Layered Logic** — Hybrid structures reflect layered logic in services, caches, or UIs
- **Interview Performance** — Real interviews test compositional thinking and stress management
- **Architectural Decisions** — Algorithmic tradeoffs directly influence latency, throughput, and infrastructure cost
- **Leadership Communication** — Clarity of thought and alignment with values in technical discussions
- **End-to-End Reasoning** — Connecting algorithms to system design to behavioral examples

## ✅ Interview Readiness Checklist

After completing this phase, you should be able to:

- [ ] Mix and reason across structures without confusing their invariants
- [ ] Finish two timed medium problems while maintaining readable, working solutions
- [ ] Articulate not just the answer, but how you structured your thought process
- [ ] Connect time complexity to infrastructure cost in system design
- [ ] Identify one algorithmic pattern that defines a service's behavior
- [ ] Clearly articulate how you think, not just what you did
- [ ] Communicate tradeoffs under stress using structured frameworks
- [ ] Defend technical and architectural reasoning end-to-end in a full interview panel
- [ ] Solve mid/hard problems while narrating tradeoffs
- [ ] Do a system design that references concrete DS/Algo instincts
- [ ] Communicate clearly under interview constraints

## 🏁 Phase Completion Criteria

You can conduct a mock interview with peers or self-record and review your performance across clarity, correctness, and composure. You can pick a service (notification, analytics, scheduler) and identify one algorithmic pattern that defines its behavior. You can write out 3 stories covering failure, teamwork, and leadership in STAR format, each ready for delivery. When under interview pressure, you can clearly articulate how you think, not just what you did.

**Interview readiness:** You're ready to defend technical and architectural reasoning end-to-end. You can solve mid/hard problems while narrating tradeoffs, do a system design that references concrete DS/Algo instincts, and communicate clearly under interview constraints. You're prepared for full senior interview panels.
