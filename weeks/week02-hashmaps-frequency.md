# Week 02 — HashMaps & Frequency as Infrastructure

**🎯 Objective**

## 💡 Why It Matters (Senior Lens)

[Inference] Caches, session stores, routing tables, feature stores: all built on map semantics. You’re expected to reason about key choice, memory usage, and worst-case behavior.

## 🧠 Work Reflection

List three hot code paths (API gateway, auth, recsys, billing) where a map is or could be used. For each: key type, expected cardinality, acceptable memory, impact if distribution is skewed.

<summary><strong>💡 Problem-Solving Hints</strong></summary>

### Pattern Hints (General)

**Approach:**
- Hint 1: When you need to count frequencies or check membership, HashMap gives you O(1) average-case lookups. What information do you need to store as the key?
- Hint 2: For frequency problems, consider: do you need the exact count, or just presence? That determines HashMap vs HashSet.
- Hint 3: Remember HashMap's worst-case is O(n) due to collisions. For interview problems, assume average O(1), but in production, consider key distribution.

**Edge Cases:**
- Empty strings or arrays
- All characters/elements are the same
- Case sensitivity (if problem doesn't specify)
- Unicode characters vs ASCII
- Very large input sizes (considering HashMap memory)

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Using HashMap when HashSet would suffice (only need membership, not count)
- Not considering character frequency vs element frequency
- Forgetting to handle empty inputs
- Using nested loops when HashMap eliminates the need

### Problem-Specific Hints

**Valid Anagram:**
- Hint 1: Two strings are anagrams if they have the same character frequencies. How can you count characters efficiently?
- Hint 2: You could sort both strings, but that's O(n log n). Can you count frequencies in O(n) using a HashMap?
- Hint 3: Count characters in first string (increment), then count in second string (decrement). If all counts are zero, they're anagrams. Or use two HashMaps and compare.

**Group Anagrams:**
- Hint 1: Anagrams have the same character frequencies. What could serve as a unique key for all anagrams of a word?
- Hint 2: You could use sorted string as key (all anagrams sort to same string), or character frequency map as key. Which is more efficient?
- Hint 3: Group words by their sorted character representation. All anagrams will have the same sorted form, so they'll map to the same key in your HashMap.

**Top K Frequent Elements:**
- Hint 1: First, count frequencies using HashMap. Then you need the K most frequent. What data structure helps you get the top K efficiently?
- Hint 2: After counting frequencies, you could sort by frequency (O(n log n)), but can you do better? Think about heap/priority queue.
- Hint 3: Use HashMap to count, then use a min-heap of size K to keep track of top K. Or use bucket sort if frequencies are bounded.

## ✅ Done When

- You can describe buckets, load factor, collisions, and worst-case complexity.
- [Inference] You challenge “just add a HashMap” with concrete questions (keys, growth, GC).
