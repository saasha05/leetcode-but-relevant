### Pattern Hints (General)

**Approach:**
- Hint 1: Behavioral questions test communication and judgment. Use STAR: Situation, Task, Action, Result.
- Hint 2: Focus on your thinking process, not just outcomes. What tradeoffs did you consider? How did you decide?
- Hint 3: Connect technical decisions to business impact. Why did this algorithm/structure choice matter?

**Edge Cases:**
- Questions about failures (be honest, show learning)
- Questions about conflicts (show collaboration)
- Questions about leadership (show influence, not authority)
- Questions about tradeoffs (show reasoning)

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Being too vague
- Not showing your thought process
- Focusing only on success stories
- Not connecting to values/impact
- Memorizing answers instead of understanding framework

### Problem-Specific Hints

**Behavioral Preparation:**
- Hint 1: Prepare 3-5 stories covering: technical challenge, failure/learning, collaboration, leadership, tradeoff decision.
- Hint 2: Each story should show: what was the situation? What was your role? What did you do? What was the result? What did you learn?
- Hint 3: Practice articulating technical tradeoffs: "I chose X over Y because... The tradeoff was... The impact was..."
