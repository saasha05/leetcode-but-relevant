## 💡 Why It Matters (Senior Lens)

This mirrors real mid-level screens — tests compositional thinking, not trivia recall.

---

## 🧠 Work Reflection

Identify what you struggled to recall fast enough — is it logic, syntax, or reasoning speed?

---

## 🧩 Deliverables

- [ ] Attempt two medium LeetCode problems end-to-end in 1.5 hours total.  
- [ ] Reflection: "Speed vs clarity tradeoff."

<summary><strong>💡 Problem-Solving Hints</strong></summary>

### Pattern Hints (General)

**Approach:**
- Hint 1: Mock interviews test problem-solving under pressure. Start by understanding the problem, then identify the pattern, then code.
- Hint 2: Communicate your thinking: state the approach, time/space complexity, edge cases before coding.
- Hint 3: If stuck, think about what data structures you know: arrays, maps, sets, stacks, queues. Which fits this problem?

**Edge Cases:**
- Review edge cases from all previous weeks
- Empty inputs
- Single element
- Very large inputs
- Boundary conditions

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Jumping to code without understanding
- Not communicating thought process
- Not handling edge cases
- Panicking when stuck
- Not asking clarifying questions

### Problem-Specific Hints

**Medium Interview Problems:**
- Hint 1: These often combine 2-3 patterns. Break into subproblems: what's the core pattern? What additional constraints?
- Hint 2: Common combinations: array + hash map, tree + recursion, graph + BFS/DFS, string + two pointers.
- Hint 3: If time is running out, explain the approach even if you can't finish coding. Show your problem-solving process.
