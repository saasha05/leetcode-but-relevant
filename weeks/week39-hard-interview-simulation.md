## 💡 Why It Matters (Senior Lens)

Hard interviews test compositional reasoning and stress management — both leadership skills.

---

## 🧠 Work Reflection

Simulate a whiteboard or notebook interview. Record and analyze your approach to debugging under pressure.

<summary><strong>💡 Problem-Solving Hints</strong></summary>

### Pattern Hints (General)

**Approach:**
- Hint 1: Hard problems often require multiple insights. Break into smaller problems. What's the core challenge?
- Hint 2: Common hard patterns: complex DP (2D+), graph algorithms (cycles, connectivity), advanced tree problems, string manipulation with constraints.
- Hint 3: Don't aim for perfect solution immediately. Start with brute force, identify bottlenecks, optimize step by step.

**Edge Cases:**
- Review edge cases from all previous weeks
- Very large inputs (considering constraints)
- Complex constraints
- Multiple edge cases interacting

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Overcomplicating the solution
- Not breaking problem into subproblems
- Giving up too early
- Not explaining partial solutions
- Ignoring constraints

### Problem-Specific Hints

**Hard Interview Problems:**
- Hint 1: These test deep understanding. Show your reasoning: why this approach? What are the tradeoffs?
- Hint 2: Often involve: multi-step DP, graph algorithms with special properties, complex data structure combinations.
- Hint 3: If completely stuck, explain what you'd need to research or what approach you'd try. Show problem-solving methodology.
