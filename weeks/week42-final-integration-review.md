## 💡 Why It Matters (Senior Lens)

True mastery is integration — showing thought process, communication, and engineering tradeoffs live.

---

## 🧠 Work Reflection

Conduct a mock with peers or self-record. Review your performance across clarity, correctness, and composure.

---

## 🧩 Deliverables

- [ ] Full mock panel run (algorithm + design + behavioral).  
- [ ] 1–2 page post-mortem of strengths and gaps.

<summary><strong>💡 Problem-Solving Hints</strong></summary>

### Pattern Hints (General)

**Approach:**
- Hint 1: Full interview panel tests integration: can you solve problems while explaining tradeoffs, design systems, and communicate clearly?
- Hint 2: Practice narrating your thought process: "I'm thinking about using X because... The tradeoff is... Let me verify the edge cases..."
- Hint 3: Connect everything: how does this algorithm pattern relate to system design? How does it show up in production?

**Edge Cases:**
- Review all edge cases from curriculum
- Time pressure scenarios
- Ambiguous requirements
- Multiple valid approaches

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Not communicating thought process
- Jumping to code too quickly
- Not connecting to real systems
- Panicking under pressure
- Not asking clarifying questions

### Problem-Specific Hints

**Final Integration:**
- Hint 1: This simulates real senior interviews. Show end-to-end thinking: problem understanding → pattern recognition → solution design → implementation → tradeoffs.
- Hint 2: Practice: solve problem while explaining. Connect to system design. Show behavioral examples. Demonstrate senior-level judgment.
- Hint 3: If stuck, show your problem-solving methodology: break into subproblems, consider alternatives, explain tradeoffs. This demonstrates thinking, not just coding.
