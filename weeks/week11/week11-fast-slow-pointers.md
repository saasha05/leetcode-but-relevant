## 💡 Why It Matters (Senior Lens)

Detecting loops = detecting recursion errors, livelocks, or workflow cycles in distributed systems.

---

## 🧠 Work Reflection

Find one service where retrigger loops or cyclic dependencies could arise. Suggest a detection or prevention strategy.

<summary><strong>💡 Problem-Solving Hints</strong></summary>

### Pattern Hints (General)

**Approach:**
- Hint 1: When you need to find middle or detect cycles, use two pointers moving at different speeds. Fast pointer moves 2x speed of slow pointer.
- Hint 2: For cycle detection: if there's a cycle, fast pointer will eventually catch slow pointer. If no cycle, fast pointer reaches end.
- Hint 3: For finding middle: when fast pointer reaches end, slow pointer is at middle. This works because fast moves twice as fast.

**Edge Cases:**
- Empty list
- Single node
- List with cycle starting at head
- Even vs odd length lists (for middle finding)
- Cycle of length 1 (self-loop)

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Not checking for null before accessing next (null pointer exception)
- Infinite loop if cycle detection logic is wrong
- Off-by-one errors in middle finding
- Not handling edge case of single node with cycle

### Problem-Specific Hints

**Linked List Cycle:**
- Hint 1: You need to detect if list has a cycle. If you traverse with one pointer, you might loop forever. How can two pointers help?
- Hint 2: Use Floyd's algorithm: slow pointer moves one step, fast moves two steps. If they meet, there's a cycle. If fast reaches null, no cycle.
- Hint 3: The key: if there's a cycle, fast pointer will eventually be in the cycle, and slow will enter later. Fast will catch up because it moves faster.

**Middle of the Linked List:**
- Hint 1: You need the middle node. If you traverse once to count, then traverse again, that's O(n) but two passes. Can you do it in one pass?
- Hint 2: Use two pointers: slow moves one step, fast moves two steps. When fast reaches end, slow is at middle.
- Hint 3: For even length, you might need to handle which middle (first or second). Check if fast.next is null (odd) or fast.next.next is null (even).

**Linked List Cycle II:**
- Hint 1: You need to find the node where the cycle begins, not just whether a cycle exists. What happens after fast and slow meet?
- Hint 2: After meeting point is found, reset one pointer to head. Move both one step at a time — they will meet at the cycle entry node.
- Hint 3: This works due to Floyd's math: the distance from head to cycle entry equals the distance from meeting point to cycle entry. Trust the math, verify with a small example.

**Find the Duplicate Number:**
- Hint 1: Values are 1..n in an array of length n+1. Treat values as pointers: index i points to nums[i]. Can you find a cycle?
- Hint 2: This maps to Linked List Cycle II: index 0 is the "head", following nums[i] as next pointers forms a cycle at the duplicate value.
- Hint 3: Apply Floyd's algorithm exactly as in Cycle II. The cycle entry = the duplicate number. No extra space needed, O(n) time.
